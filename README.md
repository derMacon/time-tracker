### Time consumer

Simple app to see which task consumes what amount of time. Programm internally manages a list of accounts for the specific tasks. The user can set a time frame that will serve as a time unit that will be tracked. When the user forgets to stop when he finished a specific task he will be asked how many units he actually worked and those will be added to the appropriate account. After tracking the time the user can generate a latex file that presents the information in a more or less pleasing way / style. 

Todo: 
* move test .csv to resource directory
* Check latex for visual representation of the data. 
* UML
